<h1>Sun-as-a-Star Workshop:</h1>
<h1>Exploring Solar Variability with Disk-Integrated Spectra</h1>
<h3>March 13-17, 2023 / Flatiron Institute / New York City</h3>

<p>
	The Sun-as-a-Star Workshop took place in March 2023. The original workshop website is archived <a href="https://bedell.space/sun_archived.html">here</a> and includes a full participant list and workshop collaboration policy.

<h2>Workshop Aims</h2>

<p>
In recent years, disk-integrated high-resolution solar spectra with broad optical wavelength coverage have become available in large quantities from ground-based spectrographs such as NEID, EXPRES, HARPS-N, PEPSI, and others. These high-fidelity Sun-as-a-star spectra give us a detailed view of how thousands of spectral lines vary on timescales from minutes to years. The primary motivation for gathering these data sets is to understand how stellar variability in Sun-like stars impacts the detection of exoplanets. Along the way, however, we stand to learn more about the Sun itself.
</p>
<p>

This workshop aims to bring together experts in heliophysics, stellar astrophysics, and exoplanetary observations to explore the scientific uses of Sun-as-a-star spectra. What can we learn about the Sunâ€™s physical processes from convection to magnetic surface features? What synergies exist with other Solar observations? What work has already been done with these spectra and how does it fit into the broader landscape of research questions in solar and stellar physics? How, in turn, can current heliophysics research inform future work in radial velocity exoplanet searches?
