<h1>Sun-as-a-Star Workshop</h1>
<h1>Exploring Solar Variability with Disc-Integrated Spectra</h1>
<h3>March 13-17, 2023 / Flatiron Institute / New York City</h3>

<p>
In recent years, disc-integrated high-resolution solar spectra with broad optical wavelength coverage have become available in large quantities from ground-based spectrographs such as NEID, EXPRES, HARPS-N, PEPSI, and others. These high-fidelity Sun-as-a-star spectra give us a detailed view of how thousands of spectral lines vary on timescales from minutes to years. The primary motivation for gathering these data sets is to understand how stellar variability in Sun-like stars impacts the detection of exoplanets. Along the way, however, we stand to learn more about the Sun itself.
</p>
<p>

This workshop aims to bring together experts in heliophysics, stellar astrophysics, and exoplanetary observations to explore the scientific uses of Sun-as-a-star spectra. What can we learn about the Sunâ€™s physical processes from convection to magnetic surface features? What synergies exist with other Solar observations? What work has already been done with these spectra and how does it fit into the broader landscape of research questions in solar and stellar physics? How, in turn, can current heliophysics research inform future work in radial velocity exoplanet searches?
</p>
<p>
	
This interdisciplinary gathering will focus on identifying opportunities for new cross-field collaborations and cross-pollination of ideas. To this end, the event will include unstructured time for breakout sessions, hacking, and interactive tutorials.



</p>

<h2>Expression of Interest Open Now</h2>

<p>
If you are interested in attending this workshop, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/z7zTW2uc2fStd4sa7">this Expression of Interest form</a>.
Invitations will be sent by January 30, 2023. 
Any further questions may be sent to <a href="mailto:mbedell@flatironinstitute.org">the SOC chair</a>.
</p>

<h2>Schedule and Location</h2>

<p>
The <i>Sun-as-a-Star Workshop</i> will take place from March 13 to March 17, 2023 at 
the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/">Flatiron Institute</a> in New York City. 
<b>Virtual participation will be possible for the majority of the event.</b>
</p>

<p>
A schedule will be made available later. Participants can expect a mix of talks
 (including introductions to various
instruments and data sets and high-level overviews of relevant past and ongoing work),
interactive breakout discussions, and hands-on collaborative working time.
</p>

<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>
A portion of this event will be spent in collaboration mode, with unstructured time for 
participants to work together on new projects. 
To ensure transparency and openness, we have adopted the
<a href="http://gaia.lol/codeofconduct.html">collaboration policy developed
for the Gaia Sprints</a>.
This policy requires that participants agree to the following:

</p><p>

All participants will be expected to openly share their ideas, expertise, code,
and interim results. Project development will proceed out in the open, among
participants and in the world.

</p><p>

Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new collaborations, and
combine projects. Any participant who contributes significantly to a project
can expect co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any participant
who gets significant contributions to a project is expected to include those
contributors as co-authors.

</p><p>

These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary data sets or
proprietary code</i>, unless the participant bringing such assets has the
rights to open them or add collaborators.

</p>

<h2 id="codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>

We are dedicated to providing an equitable and harassment-free conference experience for
everyone. We expect all participants to read and abide by the 
<a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/code-of-conduct/">Flatiron Institute Code of Conduct</a>.
